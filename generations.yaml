generations:
  - name: "First Generation (C11)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2011
    description: "The original Nissan Versa was introduced as Nissan's new entry-level subcompact, positioned below the Sentra in both size and price. Available as both a sedan and hatchback (the latter called the Versa Hatchback or Versa Note in some markets), it offered exceptional interior space for its class due to its tall roof and long wheelbase. Powered by a 1.8L four-cylinder engine producing 122 horsepower, paired with either a six-speed manual, four-speed automatic, or continuously variable transmission (CVT) depending on trim level. The exterior featured tall, practical proportions with clean, simple styling, while the interior emphasized spaciousness with surprising rear seat legroom for the segment. Standard features were minimal on base models to achieve a competitive starting price, with higher trims adding power accessories, cruise control, and upgraded audio systems. Safety features included front, side, and curtain airbags, though electronic stability control was initially optional. The first-generation Versa established itself as a value leader emphasizing practicality and interior space over styling or driving dynamics."

  - name: "Second Generation (N17 sedan/E12 hatchback)"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The second-generation Versa split into two distinct models: the Versa sedan based on the global Nissan Sunny, and the Versa Note hatchback based on the global Nissan Note, though both shared mechanical components. The sedan featured conservative styling with a three-box design, launched in 2012, while the more distinctively styled Versa Note hatchback arrived for 2014 with a more dynamic appearance and added versatility. Both were powered by a 1.6L four-cylinder engine producing 109 horsepower, paired with either a five-speed manual or continuously variable transmission (CVT), with the four-speed automatic discontinued. The interior maintained impressive space efficiency but with improved materials and design compared to the first generation, particularly in the Versa Note. Available features expanded to include NissanConnect infotainment, navigation, Around View Monitor 360-degree camera system, and keyless entry with push-button start on higher trims. Safety technology evolved throughout the generation, eventually adding available automatic emergency braking. The sedan received a styling refresh in 2015, while the Note was updated in 2017. The second-generation Versa continued the model's focus on affordability and practicality, with the sedan often positioned as the lowest-priced new car available in the United States."

  - name: "Third Generation (N18)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Versa features dramatically improved styling with proportions and design elements shared with larger Nissan sedans, including a lower and wider stance, floating roof design, and V-motion grille. Available exclusively as a sedan (with the Versa Note hatchback discontinued), it grows in width and length while reducing height compared to its predecessor. Powered by an updated 1.6L four-cylinder engine now producing 122 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a five-speed manual or continuously variable transmission (CVT). The interior represents a substantial upgrade with higher quality materials, more sophisticated design including a 'floating' touchscreen, and improved technology including an available 7-inch driver information display, 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Safety technology expanded significantly with standard Nissan Safety Shield 360 on higher trims including automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, lane departure warning, high beam assist, blind spot warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. Despite significant improvements in design, features, and technology, the third-generation Versa maintains competitive pricing, continuing its value proposition while offering much more premium appearance and features than previous generations. The new Versa positions itself as a compelling alternative for buyers seeking sedan styling and driving dynamics in an increasingly crossover-dominated market."
